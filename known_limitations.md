# WPA Known Limitations

## Apps are always active

Apps are always active if they are installed. There is no activation process or UI option to temporarily deactive an app. To remove an app, you must currently delete the folder from /wp-content/wpa/{app_dir_name}.

In future versions of WPA we will offer a UI based activation with deactivation option to allow apps to be handled similarly to WordPress plugins.
